## Description of the task
The company is developing a web application for online learning. The main
functionality of the platform is the ability
for users to pass tests and receive reports on the results. You need
to test a new application module related to the analysis
of test results.
## Case conditions
* Functional requirements of the module:
The user must see the test result immediately after completion.
* The result includes: the total percentage of correct answers, a list
of incorrect answers with explanations and recommendations.
* Taking into account the time of passing the test (including a warning for 5
minutes before the end).
* Reports are saved in the user's personal account.
 #### Additional aspects to check:
* Compatibility on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
* Correct operation on mobile devices.
Error handling (for example, connection loss).

## Task
1. Requirements analysis:
* Find potential gaps and ask clarifying questions.
2. Developing test cases:
* Write 5-7 test cases for functional testing.
* Develop 3 test cases to verify compatibility.
3. Testing:
* Suggest approaches for performing manual module testing.
* Determine which scenarios can be automated.

4. Reporting:
* Prepare a report on the defects found (describe at least 2
hypothetical bugs).
* Assess how serious the detected problems are and suggest
priorities for fixing them.

#### Methodologies and tools
Specify the tools that you would use (for example, Postman for
API, BrowserStack for cross-browser testing).
