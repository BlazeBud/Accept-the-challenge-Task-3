#### Approaches to manual testing:  
* Testing functionality on different devices and browsers: for each browser and device (mobile and desktop), you need to perform all functional tests to make sure that it works correctly on different platforms.
* UI/UX check: You need to manually check the display of all interface elements on different screen resolutions (for example, for mobile devices).
* Error tolerance testing: Check how the system reacts to connection disconnection, server errors, and reconnection.
#### Scenarios for automation:  
* Automation of calculations of correct answers and recommendations: you can automate the verification of the correctness of the percentage of correct answers and the display of recommendations.
* Testing the saving of reports in your personal account: Automating the verification that reports are saved and displayed correctly.
* Checking the time of passing the test: you can automate the verification of the correct operation of the timer and the appearance of warnings.
