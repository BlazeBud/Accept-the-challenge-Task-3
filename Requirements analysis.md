## Requirements analysis: potential gaps and clarifying questions
##### Gaps and questions that may arise:
1. __The total percentage of correct answers:__
* How will partial completion of tasks be taken into account (for example, multiple choice questions or grade points)? It is necessary to clarify how the percentage of correct answers is calculated for different types of questions. 
* How will the result be displayed for tests with multiple attempts? Will the result of the last attempt be shown or will the result of all attempts be aggregated?
2. __List of incorrect answers with explanations:__
* How will error feedback be organized? Will there be explanations for each incorrect answer or only for some types of questions (e.g. open-ended questions, multiple choice)?
* Are there any requirements for the format of explanations (e.g. text, video or links)?
3. __Notes:__
* What recommendations will be provided to the user? Will these be recommendations for improving knowledge or just tips on the topics of the test?
* How will the recommendation system work for different types of users: beginners, experienced or experts?
4. _The time of passing the test:__
* It is necessary to clarify how the situation will be handled when the user completes the test before the end of time, but does not click the "Finish" button. How will the time be taken into account?
* Is there a need for differences in the timing mechanism (for example, different timers for different types of tests)?
* Is there a requirement for the accuracy of time tracking (for example, up to a second)?
5. __Error handling (for example, loss of connection):__
* What kind of errors follow the processing (for example, loss of connection to the server, server failure)?
* Will there be a recovery mechanism?
* Will the user be notified about the restoration of communication, and will his response be lost?
6. __Saving reports in the personal account:__
* What exactly should be included in the "personal account" section?
* The ability to sort and filter results by date or type of test?
* It is necessary to specify how long the report will be stored in the system. Is the automatic deletion of data taken into account after the time has elapsed?
* Will it be possible to download reports in formats such as PDF or Excel?
